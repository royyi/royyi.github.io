        <h1>Roy Yi</h1>    

        <p>Hi! Welcome to my site!</p>

        <p>I am a fourth year computer science major at UC Davis.  Currently, I am also a SRE intern
        (site reliability engineer) at Instructure, the makers of Canvas.</p>

        <p>My interests include algorithms, AI, machine learning, data science, and teaching.  Iâ€™m
        always seeking to improve my CS knowledge and strengthen my software engineering skills.</p>
            
        <p>I am an undergraduate researcher in LPW lab, and my research focuses on the development
        of the computational chemistry NEB method.  You can read more about my research here.</p>
            
        <p>Finally, I teach Python programming at theCoderSchool, and I was also a former math
        instructor at Mathnasium.  You can find out more about my work experience here.</p>
