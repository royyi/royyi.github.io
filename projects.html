            <h3>ML Music Genre Classifier</h3>

            <p>
            This project uses a neural network model to predict the genre of music from an audio file.
            The model is built using the scikit-learn module in Python.
            It also has a web interface built using flask and react.js that allows the user to upload a
            file to get a prediction.
            </p>

            <h3>L-Store Database</h3>

            <p>
            This is a high performance No-SQL database I built for my database class.
            It supports multi-threaded operations, persistent disk storage, and indexing on the primary key.
            Our project was one of the most performant implementations in the class.
            </p>

            <h3>Connect 4 AI</h3>

            <p>
            This project uses minimax with alpha beta pruning and monte carlo tree search to play a game
            of Connect 4. The AI is powerful and wins against me most of the time. I built this project
            with my student in Python.
            </p>

            <h3>React Reservoir Website</h3>

            <p>
            This is a JavaScript website, using React.js for the frontend server, and Node.js for the
            backend server. The website displays a chart of water reservoir levels in California for
            the selected month, and makes an API call to the CDEC government site to fetch the latest data.
            </p>

            <h3>Simple Shell</h3>

            <p>
            This is a simple Unix shell I built in C for my operating systems class. It uses
            OS syscalls to execute commands and support features such as piping, output redirection,
            and environment variables.
            </p>

            <h3>Image Pixelator</h3>

            <p>
            This is a project I coded in C, which uses the pixel values of a grayscale image to convert
            the image to unicode blocks.
            </p>

            <h3>Tetris</h3>

            <p>
            This is the classic block falling game, coded using the Pygame library in Python.
            This is one of the projects I created to teach my student how to code using
            object-oriented programming.
            </p>

            <h3>Pong Game</h3>

            <p>
            This is the classic arcade tennis game. It is also coded using Pygame in Python.
            </p>
